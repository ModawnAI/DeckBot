Cascading Retrieval (aka hybrid search)
In this notebook, you'll learn how to use Pinecone to combine the benefits of semantic and lexical search using a technique called cascading retrieval or hybrid search with two indexes.

Semantic search and lexical search are powerful information retrieval techniques, but each has notable limitations. For example, semantic search can miss results based on exact keyword matches, especially in scenarios involving domain-specific terminology. While lexical search can miss results based on relationships, such as synonyms and paraphrases.

When dense and sparse retrieval are combined along with reranking — an approach we call cascading retrieval — you get up to 48% better performance than either sparse or dense alone.

You can read more about how cascading retrieval works here.

In the example below, we'll search over financial headlines.

Setup
First, let's install the necessary libraries, define some helper functions, and set the API keys we will need to use in this notebook.


[ ]
%pip install -qU \
  pinecone~=7.3 \
  pinecone-notebooks==0.1.1
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
🚨 Note: the above pip install is formatted for Jupyter notebooks. If running elsewhere you may need to drop the !.

Helper functions
We'll define these helper functions to print out the search results and to deduplicate and merge the dense and sparse results.


[ ]
def print_hits(results):
    for hit in results['result']['hits']:
        print(f"id: {hit['_id']}, score: {round(hit['_score'], 2)} text: {hit['fields']['chunk_text']}")

def merge_chunks(h1, h2):
    """Get the unique hits from two search results and return them as single array of {'_id', 'chunk_text'} dicts, printing each dict on a new line."""
    # Deduplicate by _id
    deduped_hits = {hit['_id']: hit for hit in h1['result']['hits'] + h2['result']['hits']}.values()
    # Sort by _score descending
    sorted_hits = sorted(deduped_hits, key=lambda x: x['_score'], reverse=True)
    # Transform to format for reranking
    result = [{'_id': hit['_id'], 'chunk_text': hit['fields']['chunk_text'], '_score': hit['_score']} for hit in sorted_hits]
    return result
Get and set the Pinecone API key
We will need a free Pinecone API key. The code below will either help you sign up for a new Pinecone account or authenticate you. Then it will create a new API key and set it as an environment variable. If you are not running in a Colab environment, it will prompt you to enter the API key and then set it in the environment.


[ ]
import os
from getpass import getpass

def get_pinecone_api_key():
    """
    Get Pinecone API key from environment variable or prompt user for input.
    Returns the API key as a string.

    Only necessary for notebooks. When using Pinecone yourself,
    you can use environment variables or the like to set your API key.
    """
    api_key = os.environ.get("PINECONE_API_KEY")

    if api_key is None:
        try:
            # Try Colab authentication if available
            from pinecone_notebooks.colab import Authenticate
            Authenticate()
            # If successful, key will now be in environment
            api_key = os.environ.get("PINECONE_API_KEY")
        except ImportError:
            # If not in Colab or authentication fails, prompt user for API key
            print("Pinecone API key not found in environment.")
            api_key = getpass("Please enter your Pinecone API key: ")
            # Save to environment for future use in session
            os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"] = api_key

    return api_key

api_key = get_pinecone_api_key()
Pinecone API key not found in environment.
2. Create Pinecone index and load data
Initializing Pinecone

[ ]
from pinecone import Pinecone

# Initialize client

pc = Pinecone(
    api_key=api_key,
    # You can remove this parameter for your own projects
    source_tag="pinecone_examples:docs:cascading_retrieval"
)
Create Pinecone indexes with integrated embedding
We'll need a dense and a sparse index, both configured to use integrated embedding, allowing us to pass text rather than vectors.

Integrated embedding allows you to specify the creation of a Pinecone index with a specific Pinecone-hosted embedding model, which makes it easy to interact with the index. To learn more about integrated embedding, including what other models are available, check it out here.

Creating our dataset
The example data set below contains financial headlines.

Note: This data set has only 96 records, the maximum allowed by the embedding model in one batch. If we had more than 96 records, we'd have to upsert in batches.

Upserting data into the Pinecone indexes
Here, we embed and upsert the data into Pinecone. During the upsert process, a vector embedding is created for each record using the embedding model we specified on index creation. These vector embeddings are then stored in the index with any additional info, or metadata, we specify. Read more about metadata here.

We specify a namespace called "headlines", which is a higher level unit of organization when interacting with Pinecone but has some important benefits. Querying by namespace performs a sort of broad filter to only records that exist in that namespace. This can be used for isolating customer data for multi-tenancy. And when you divide records into namespaces in a logical way, you speed up queries by ensuring only relevant records are scanned. You can learn more about namespaces here.


[ ]
namespace = "headlines"

sparse_index.upsert_records(records = data, namespace = namespace)

[ ]
sparse_index.describe_index_stats()
{'index_fullness': 0.0,
 'metric': 'dotproduct',
 'namespaces': {'headlines': {'vector_count': 96}},
 'total_vector_count': 96,
 'vector_type': 'sparse'}

dense_index.upsert_records(records = data, namespace = namespace)

3. Running queries
Now that our indexes are populated we can begin making queries.

Since we're using Pinecone's integrated embedding, we can query our indexes with the text we want to search for. The search query is vectorized using the same embedding model we specified earlier and then results are returned based on either cosine similarity (dense index) or dotproduct score (sparse index).

We'll search across the sparse and dense indexes with the same query. Note that the resulting scores for dense vs sparse search are on a different scale due to the distance metrics, making them difficult to compare. We will resolve this using reranking in the next step.
